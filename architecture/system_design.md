# Personal Research Agent System Design

## Implementation approach

For the personal research agent system, I'll design a multi-agent architecture with an orchestrator at its center. The system will focus on helping users organize their research, track their interests, and learn from their behavior to provide increasingly personalized assistance.

Key technical considerations:

1. **Multi-agent Framework**: We'll implement multiple specialized agents coordinated through an orchestrator, using OpenAI Agents SDK as the foundation.

2. **Memory Management**: Long-term memory for user preferences and research history will be implemented using vector databases that are saved in OpenAI for semantic search capabilities.

3. **Web Interaction**: For tracking clicked citations and links, we'll build a simple browser like frontend.

4. **Self-reflection**: The system will periodically analyze user behavior and research patterns to update its understanding of user preferences.

5. **Code Search**: For programming-related research, we'll integrate with code repositories and search APIs.

### Technology Stack:

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for API endpoints
- **NLP Processing**: OpenAI Agents API for text understanding and generation
- **Frontend**: React Typescript with Tailwind CSS (Shadcn UI components) for user interface
- **Memory**: Vector stores for semantic retrieval and PostgreSQL for structured data
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for easy deployment

## Data structures and interfaces

The system will be organized around these core components:

1. **Orchestrator**: Central coordinator that routes user requests to appropriate agents
2. **Research Memory**: Stores and retrieves user's research history and preferences
3. **Specialized Agents**: Various agents like Document Processor, Link Tracker, Code Finder, etc.
4. **User Profile**: Maintains user preferences and research style
5. **Content Analyzer**: Analyzes and categorizes research content

## Program call flow

The typical interaction flow will involve:

1. User submits a research query
2. Orchestrator analyzes the query and user history, clarifies if query is vague
3. Orchestrator delegates to appropriate specialized agents
4. Agents process the request and return results
5. Results are aggregated and presented to user
6. User interactions are tracked and stored in memory
7. Periodically, the system performs self-reflection to update user profiles

## Anything UNCLEAR

1. **Privacy Considerations**: The detailed requirements for user data privacy and storage limitations are not specified. We should consider implementing data retention policies and encryption for sensitive information.

2. **Integration Points**: The exact methods for tracking user clicks on citations/links will depend on how the system is integrated with frontend experience.

3. **Authentication**: User authentication requirements (clerk) need to be worked on later.

4. **Deployment Environment**: The deployment environment (cloud, on-premises) might affect certain design choices.
